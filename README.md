## Background

Interface for BlockPro market place. An offer is sent to BlockPro via Rest API and stored in the Doichain Blockchain. Data from the offer like meter_id, date and amount of electricity ordered are also stored in OrbitDB. 

If the production and consumption of the ordered electricity has taken place, a matching between meter data and the order is sent back to the market place.
